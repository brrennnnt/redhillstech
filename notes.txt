That's awesome to hear — well done! 🎉💪

Now that it’s working:

✅ You might consider next:

📂 Logging form submissions (to a file or database) as a backup.

🛡️ Adding reCAPTCHA to block spam bots.

🎨 Improving the form UX (e.g., success messages, inline validation).

📧 Sending confirmation emails to customers, too (if desired).

If you ever want help with any of those upgrades, just say the word.

Enjoy the win — you’ve earned it! 🥳
